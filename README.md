Get Moai Website
=====================

This is a proof of concept for the Moai SDK website. The intention is to evaluate GitHub as a possible home for GetMoai.com.

##Contributing to the Site
===

Feel free to clone this repo and make your changes. Contribute to this site by making a pull request.

##Tools
===
So far this site is made using the following tools:

* jykll - <http://jekyllrb.com>
* bootstrap 3 - <http://getbootstrap.com>

Github Pages automaticaly supports Jykll (see: <https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages>)

## Getting Started
===
You don't have to install Jekyll to contribute to the repo, but it would be helpful. If something is not building as expected installing Jekyll would allow you to view the site localy on your computer.

First you will need to install Ruby on your system (If you are running Mac OS X, no need - it's already installed). Once you have Ruby, you will need the following Gems:

* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

Once installed, you can run the following command:

`bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`

This will tell jekyll to compile your the site and server it up locally on port 4000 (<http://localhost:4000>)

The 'watch' switch will tell Jekyll to recompile your site when a file is changed.
